The analysis of our algorithm focuses on understanding its correctness, as well as time complexity in different scenarios: best case, worst case, and average case.

Correctness of Dijkstra's Algorithm

Initialization:
Distances from the source node to all other nodes set to infinite (Integer.MAX_VALUE).
Distance from source node to itself set to zero.

Relaxation:
Iteratively update distances to neighboring nodes.
If a shorter path is found, update the distance.

Termination:
Algorithm processes all nodes, ensuring shortest paths are finalized.

Proof of Correctness:
Base Case: Shortest path from the source to itself is zero.
Inductive Step: Extending correctness to neighboring nodes through relaxation.

Asymptotic Analysis and Recurrence

Recurrence Relation:

T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(log n)
O(log n) is the time complexity for priority queue operations.
Time Complexity:

Worst Case: O((V+E)logV)
Best Case: O((V+E)logV)
Average Case: O((V+E)logV)

Explanation:
Priority queue operations (insert, extract-min) dominate time complexity.

Growth of Function - Worst, Best, and Average Case Analysis

Worst Case:
Time Complexity: O((V+E)logV)
Processes all vertices and edges.

Best Case:
Time Complexity: O((V+E)logV)
All vertices and edges processed to ensure shortest paths.

Average Case:
Time Complexity: O((V+E)logV)
Time complexity remains dependent on vertices and edges.

Greedy Algorithm for Supply Distribution

Steps Involved:

Initialization:
Precompute shortest paths for all pairs of vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Supply Distribution:
Distribute supplies based on the precomputed shortest paths and demand priorities.

Detailed Time Complexity Analysis:

The Greedy Technique for supply distribution, when analyzed in isolation, has different time complexities for best, average, and worst cases depending on the specifics of the scenario. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its performance in various cases:

Best Case
Scenario: All demands can be met by supplies from a single location without needing to scan through multiple supply locations.
Time Complexity: O(V logV) for managing the priority queue.
Reason: Only a minimal number of priority queue operations are required, as supplies can be fulfilled from a single or minimal number of supply locations.

Average Case
Scenario: Demands are distributed such that the algorithm has to consider multiple supply locations but not all of them.
Time Complexity: O(V^2)
Reason: For most vertices, the algorithm will have to check several supply locations to meet the demands, leading to O(V) operations per vertex.

Worst Case
Scenario: Every demand requires scanning through all supply locations to find the optimal supply route, and priority queue operations dominate.
Time Complexity: O(V^2 logV)
Reason: Each vertex's demand requires checking all other vertices (supply locations), and maintaining the priority queue for all demands increases the complexity due to frequent insertions and deletions.

The Greedy Technique for supply distribution can vary significantly in performance based on the distribution of supplies and demands, with worst-case scenarios dominated by frequent priority queue operations.
